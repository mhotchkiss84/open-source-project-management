# open-source-project-management
An open source project management solution for all enviroments built with open source technologies.

# The why
I was working on a project like this for my server side capstone project for my Full Stack .Net development course. I noticed after looking that there really only seems to be only one open source project mangement option. I think that it will be fun to try and make another option that users can host locally or on a server that doesn't have the restrictions of the back end being locked down to Linux. I use Linux and love it but I just want something that is loaded with features and anyone with any type of operation system can use it.
